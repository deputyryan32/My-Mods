# DeputyMods FireFX V2.5

## Overview
Welcome to **DeputyMods FireFX V2.5**! This version is all about delivering **chaotic**, **ultra-realistic**, and **longer-lasting fire effects**. Weâ€™ve significantly modified the fire dynamics to make explosions and environmental fires far more dramatic.

### Key Changes:
- **Chaos and Intensity:** Increased burn time, burn strength, and flame generation across multiple materials for **maximum destruction**.
- **Ultra Realism:** Fires now last much longer and behave more intensely on key surfaces like wood, vegetation, and vehicle materials.
- **Materials Overhaul:**
  - Fires on **vegetation** and **organic materials** (like grass, trees, and wood) now burn for **up to 1000 seconds** with increased flame strength.
  - **Concrete, metal, and hard surfaces** are now more resistant but will still experience prolonged fire effects for added realism.
  - Fires on **vehicles** will burn much hotter and longer.
- **FireFX:** All fire-related effects are updated under **DeputyMods** for consistency.

## Changelog:
- **Burn Times** increased dramatically across all materials.
- **Burn Strength** amplified to make fires spread more destructively.
- Use of both **fire_map_slow** and **fire_map_quick** for varied fire behavior depending on the material.
- Increased **explosive chaos** for ultra-realistic environmental destruction.

## Installation:
1. Navigate to `GTA V Directory > Mods > Update > Update.RPF > Common > Data > Effects`.
