The reason I am telling you how to make a FireFX mod yourself is because I have been VERY busy lately with my .NET mods. I haven't updated FireFX in a very LONG time and I want to help you make your own.

I am currently in High School, and I haven't had time to update my mods much lately at all. I have been VERY busy with school and other projects.
