**Version 4.0 (December 2024)**

markdown
**New Features:**
- **FireFX Mod Update**: A complete overhaul of the `firefx.dat` file to improve fire dynamics. Users can now tweak the fire spread, burn time, intensity, and more to create customized fire effects for different materials (e.g., wood, grass, concrete, etc.).
- **Realistic Fire Effects**: Adjusted material properties to make fire more realistic. Materials like wood, grass, and metal now burn with different behaviors based on the new parameters.
- **User Customization**: Users can now easily modify their `firefx.dat` file to create unique fire behavior for different surfaces. 
- **More Intensity and Longer Fires**: Adjustments made to fire intensity and burn times across materials. Fires will last longer and burn more intensely based on the new parameters.

**Changes:**
- Increased fire intensity and burn time across several material types, including wood, grass, and hay.
- Material entries like `CONCRETE`, `WOOD`, `GRASS`, and `METAL` have been optimized for better fire dynamics.
- New fire map options (`fire_map_intense`, `fire_map_quick`, etc.) are now available for more varied fire behavior.
