# Second Amendment NPCs

## Description
The *Second Amendment NPCs* mod enhances NPC behavior in GTA V by equipping every NPC with a firearm and enabling them to use it if provoked. NPCs will not engage in combat automatically but will defend themselves if threatened, making interactions more dynamic and immersive.

## Features
- All NPCs carry a firearm.
- NPCs engage in combat only when provoked, adding a realistic self-defense behavior.

## Installation
1. Compile the provided `.cs` script to a `.dll` file using Visual Studio.
2. Place the `.dll` file in the `scripts` folder within your GTA V directory.
