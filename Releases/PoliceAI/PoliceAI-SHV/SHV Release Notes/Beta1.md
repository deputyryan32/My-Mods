# **PoliceAI SHV Edition** - Version Beta 1

### **Mod Version**: Beta 1  
### **Release Date**: 10/16/2024  
### **Status**: [WIP]

---

## **Overview**

**PoliceAI SHV Edition** is a custom mod designed to overhaul the police response system in **GTA V**. This mod uses **ScriptHookVDotNet** to dynamically alter how police forces behave during pursuits, introducing a variety of new features and AI behaviors that increase difficulty and realism.

> **Note**: This is the **ScriptHookV (SHV)** version of **PoliceAI**, originally designed for **Rage Plugin Hook (RPH)** and **LSPDFR**. It is reworked to run with **ScriptHookVDotNet** for wider use beyond LSPDFR scenarios.

With customizable settings and various AI enhancements, the mod adds depth to police chases and player evasion strategies. The police now use smarter tactics, deploy SWAT teams, set up roadblocks, and even call in helicopters and snipers to deal with high-level threats.

## **Features in Beta 1**

1. **Dynamic Roadblocks**  
   Police now set up roadblocks at strategic locations during high-speed pursuits based on the player's direction and position.

2. **Helicopter Support**  
   Helicopters spawn at higher wanted levels, track the player's movements from above, and open fire when necessary.

3. **SWAT Team Deployment**  
   At a 5-star wanted level, SWAT units are deployed with armored vehicles and tactical weapons to intercept the player.

4. **Spike Strips**  
   Police deploy spike strips during chases to flatten the player's vehicle tires and slow them down.

5. **Snipers**  
   Snipers will be deployed at high vantage points when the player reaches extreme wanted levels, targeting the player from afar.

6. **Police Checkpoints**  
   During pursuits, police set up checkpoints where vehicles are blocked and inspected, making it harder for the player to escape.
