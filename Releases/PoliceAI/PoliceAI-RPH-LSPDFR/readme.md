# PoliceAI

**Made By: DeputyMods**

## Overview

I created **PoliceAI** because I was fed up with how bad the police AI was in the game. As a player who enjoys playing as a cop, I got tired of my fellow officers ramming into me or just being useless during chases. This mod is here to fix that and make the police smarter and more helpful when chasing criminals.

## Purpose

The main reason for **PoliceAI** is to make police chases more fun and realistic. No more officers crashing into you or doing nothing while you're trying to catch suspects. Now, they'll actually help in a useful way by avoiding reckless behavior and using smart tactics to take down criminals. It makes the game feel more like real police work!


## Future Updates

There's a lot more planned for this mod! Right now, it focuses mainly on improving police pursuits, but I'm already working on adding more features to make the police even smarter in other areas. I put this version out to give everyone a taste of what's to come, and you can expect more updates soon.

## Tested and Ready

**PoliceAI** has been fully tested to ensure it works smoothly in-game, so you can feel confident using it. If you run into any issues, just reach out!

## Installation

1. Download the latest version of PoliceAI.
2. Drag and drop the contents into your GTA V directory. Windows will automatically sort the files for you.
3. Start the game and enjoy better police chases!
