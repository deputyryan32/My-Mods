# What's New in PistolRedirect v2.0

### New Features and Improvements:
- **INI Support Added**: You can now customize which pistols the mod allows by editing the `PistolRedirect.ini` file. This provides full control over which weapons are treated as pistols in the game.
- **Pre-made INI File**: A default `PistolRedirect.ini` file is included, which is configured to allow **all pistols** by default. You can easily modify this file to enable or disable specific pistols as per your preference.

### How to Use the New INI Feature:
1. Open the `PistolRedirect.ini` file located in your **scripts** folder.
2. Set `true` or `false` for each pistol in the list to specify which pistols the mod should allow.
3. By default, all pistols are enabled.

Enjoy the new flexibility and customization in version 2.0!
