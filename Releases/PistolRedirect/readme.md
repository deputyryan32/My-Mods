# PistolRedirect by DeputyRyan

**PistolRedirect** is a ScriptHookVDotNet mod for **GTA V** that automatically switches the player's weapon to a pistol whenever a non-pistol weapon is selected, while still allowing the player to use their fists. Additionally, any modifications to the pistol (such as suppressors or extended clips) are automatically removed to keep the weapon in its default state.

## Features
- Automatically redirects the player's weapon selection to a pistol, unless the player selects fists.
- Removes any attachments or modifications (e.g., suppressors, extended clips) from the pistol.
- Displays a 5-second on-screen message thanking the player for using the mod.
- Keeps the gameplay balanced by restricting weapons to pistols only.

## How to Install
1. Ensure that you have **ScriptHookV** and **ScriptHookVDotNet** installed.
2. Download and install **LemonUI** from [LemonUI GitHub](https://github.com/justalemon/LemonUI/releases).

## Usage
